Level and option approach :

subsequence of abc 

at level 0 get the contribution from a as a has 2 choices it can contribute in subsequence answer or it cannot contribute in subsequence.
at level 1 get the contribution from b as b has 2 choices it can contribute in subsequence answer or it cannot contribute in subsequence.
at level 2 get the contribution from c as c has 2 choices it can contribute in subsequence answer or it cannot contribute in subsequence.

once your string's length becomes zero print the ans it will have the subsequence.
