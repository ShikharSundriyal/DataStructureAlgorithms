Recursion on the way up approach : 

  Expectation : Get all keypad combination for 789 

  Faith : we will get the keypad combination for 89 . example [ax,ad,af,ds]

  From faith to expectation : for example 7 corresponds to abc , then the answer that we got for smaller problem i.e 89 we need to add 'a' to all elements of 89 answer,then add 'b' to all the elements of 89 answer and similarly for 'c'.
