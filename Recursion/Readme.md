2 types : <br/>
Recursion on the way down -- (faith and expectation approach) <br/>
we will solve the problem when falling down on the stack.<br/>
on the top we have the smallest problem.<br/>
Returns something<br/>

Recursion on the way up -- (level and option approach at each level we solve one small problem ,move up and pass your contribution via variables to next level)<br/>
we will solve the problem while going up.<br/>
Does not return something.<br/>
On the top of the stack we will have our answer.<br/>
As while going up we need to give our contribution we need help of additional variables in the function. <br/>
